## About Me

I am a Senior Engineer with **6+ years of experience** in designing and developing robust systems:

### 🔹 Software Engineering
- Java-based automation frameworks for **UI, Mobile, and API testing**  
- Test methodologies: **TDD / BDD** using TestNG, JUnit, Cucumber & Gherkin  
- Frameworks: **Page Object Model, Hybrid & Modular frameworks**  
- API automation using **RestAssured & Postman**  
- **CI/CD automation** with Jenkins, Maven & Docker  

### 🔹 Backend Engineering
- Building **scalable backend systems** using Java & Spring Boot  
- Designing & developing **REST APIs**  
- **Microservices architecture & best practices**  
- Clean architecture, modular design, and **system reliability**  

### 🔹 AI & Machine Learning
- Python-based **AI/ML solutions** for predictive analytics and automation  
- Libraries & frameworks: **TensorFlow, PyTorch, scikit-learn, pandas, NumPy**  
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP) & Computer Vision** projects  
- Integration of **ML models into backend services**  

I enjoy building systems that are **clean, scalable, and efficient**, whether it's automation frameworks, backend services, or AI-powered solutions.
